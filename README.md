# Yolov3

In this Project,we are going to do object detection using YOLO v3 on pre-trained dataset.

First :

-->goto darknet website and download the yolo3.weights files and place it in yolo-coco-data folder .
                link:https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
                
 Second:
 
 1.yolo-3-image.py:::Just run this file to detect object in single image and it can work for any image.Just replace path of the image in the beginning(cv2.imread(""))


2.yolo-3-video.py:::Just run this file to detect object in video and it can work for any video.Just replace path of the image in the beginning(cv2.videocap..(""))

3.yolo-3-camera.py::Just run this file to detect object in live video.Just replace path of the image in the beginning(cv2.videocap..(""))
